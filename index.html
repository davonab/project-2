      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Hello everyone!! My name is Davon Branch and I am a second year
      Information Technology and Management major at Illinois Institute
      of Technology. My hometown is in Bellwood, IL which is located in the west
      suburbs. I live on campus in MSV.

      <h3>What I Like To Do</h3>
      <p>I enjoy learning new skills. I played trumpet from seventh grade up until
        I graduated high school. While I was in high school, I participated in
        marching band and performed in several parades including the Bud Billiken Parade.
        I enjoy watching the series Law and Order: SVU, Empire, and Star. My
        favorite movie to watch is Transformers. Also, whenever it's warm outside, I
        enjoy swimming. I even took swimming lessons when I was younger. The #1 activity
        that I enjoy doing the most is taking pictures. During the summer, I was apart of
        a modeling group and I enjoyed it. I listen to music most of my time and
        my favorite genres are R&amp;B, Hip-Hop, Gospel. My family and I often take
        summer vacations to Florida and I enjoy them a lot. Hopefully, we will have
        a chance to go on a cruise soon.

      <h3>Life Goals</h3>
      <p>I am working to graduate with a Master's in ITM, specializing in
        IT management/entrepreneurship. I want to start
        my career as soon as I graduate college. Become the most dedicated worker
        in my field, learning new skills everyday. I also want to start a family and
        then retire at a reasonable age and travel the world with them.
